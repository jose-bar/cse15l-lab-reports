# **Lab Report 5**

## Part 1 â€“ Debugging Scenario

### Words not displaying on server  ```#429```

Hi, 

I am starting up a server I made to add and remove words to a list but when I run I try to remove a word, it only removes some of the instances of 
those words that contain the query. I am starting up the server with a bash script (idk if this would be a problem) and most of the code is copied 
from the number server we had during lab. The rest of the commands work, I just cannot remove properly. The script bananify.sh just adds 5 bananas to the list.
